# ZED EDGE: Stable Releases Are for NPCs

## Why This Exists

Let's face it - the Zed team moves faster than a caffeinated squirrel on a coding binge. By the time you finish reading this sentence, they've probably pushed three new commits that break everything in exciting new ways.

This script is for the brave souls who want to live on the bleeding edge of Zed development, where the only constant is change and the only guarantee is that your build will be outdated in minutes not hours.

## What This Script Does

* **Builds Zed from source** - Like compiling your own coffee beans because instant just isn't good enough
* **Checks for updates every minute** - Because FOMO is real when you're dealing with Zed's commit velocity
* **Self-destructs gracefully** - If new code appears mid-build, it'll nuke the current build and start fresh like a phoenix rising from the ashes of your wasted CPU cycles
* **Installs with style** - Complete with custom branding because we all need to feel special while our code fails to compile

## Installation Instructions (For the Foolhardy)

```bash
# Step 1: Clone this repository
git clone [https://github.com/arrrrny/zed-edge.git](https://github.com/arrrrny/zed-edge.git)
cd zed-edge

# Step 2: Run the script and abandon all hope
chmod +x build_zed_edge.sh
./build_zed_edge.sh

# Step 3: Wait while contemplating your life choices

## Features You Didn't Ask For But Got Anyway

* **Commit Paranoia Mode**: Checks for new commits more often than you check your ex's social media
* **Build Optimizations**: Uses every CPU core you have because your electricity bill wasn't high enough
* **Custom Branding**: Because nothing says "I live dangerously" like renaming open-source software
* **Automatic Restart**: When new code appears, it kills your build faster than the Zed team deprecates features

## Known Side Effects

May cause:

* Existential dread when you realize how fast technology moves
* Spontaneous combustion of lesser text editors
* Urge to rewrite everything in Rust
* Mild-to-severe addiction to typing `git pull`

## The Inevitable AI Disclosure

Let's not pretend this README wrote itself. While you were busy contemplating the fragility of software dependencies, this documentation was ruthlessly generated by:

**DeepSeek Chat** - because apparently even sarcastic technical writing can now be automated. Consider this your friendly reminder that the robots are coming for the creative jobs first. The script may be yours, but the words? Those belong to the machine uprising.

## Special thanks to:

* The Zed team, for their pathological inability to stop coding
* GitHub, for hosting our collective descent into build system madness
* You, for reading this far instead of actually being productive

**Remember**: in a world where even READMEs are AI-generated, the only edge that matters is ZED EDGE. Now go compile something before the machines do it for you.
